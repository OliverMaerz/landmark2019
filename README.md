### Tips: 

Neither OpenOffice/LibreOffice nor Google Sheets seem to be able to hadle the large csv files. To upload them to Google split them with `split -d -l 200000 --additional-suffix=.csv train.csv train.part.` and `split -d -l 100000 --additional-suffix=.csv train_attribution.csv train_attribution.part`.
